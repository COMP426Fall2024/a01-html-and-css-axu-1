            <p> Myths were typically used to explain the unexplainable or confront the mysterious and taboo. It is no surprise then that modern myths tend to be horror-adjacent. While things like the origin of rain are now clear to us, the depths of the internet and the wilderness are still mysterious to many, so these are prime topics for creepypastas.</p>

        <p> Even if told via first person accounts, creepypastas/online horror stories and legends are more like traditional fiction.</p>

        <p> Notice that the origin of most stories is via a forum - a place for ordinary, relatively anonymous netizens to gether. It is not officially published, government-supported, or in the "mainstream" - truly, it is distributed in the same way that folklore might be.</p>
