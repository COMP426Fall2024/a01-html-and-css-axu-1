            Urban Legends and their manifestation via the Internet 
        </h1>
        <p>When most people think of mythology, they think of it from a historical standpoint.
            Mythology typically refers to the shared stories and beliefs of ancient cultures before the proliferation of Abrahamic religion and is associated with paganism. Think the Greeks, Romans, etc. 
            This is normal, because we have grown up with a Eurocentric worldview.</p>
        <p>However, if view mythology through an anthropological or sociological lens, then you, the reader, are currently participating in the creation of a shared mythology right now, in the modern era!</p>
        
        <p>The internet has gifted us the ability to create collective narratives and motifs (which you may recognize as being... memes) in much the same way as oral histories and books did in the past. Only now, we can cross cultural barriers.</p>
        
        <p>Since the internet is interactive, the barrier of entry for participating in and contributing to this shared mythos is much lower, and it presents new and exciting opportunities for narratives to interact with the audience through the fourth wall.</p>
